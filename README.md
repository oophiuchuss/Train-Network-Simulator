# Train-Network-Simulator
Project for simulating train network written in Java.
There is implemented a lot of features: multithreading, collision for trainsets, Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest path for train.
In project you have a lot of options in menu, such as creating trains, stations, connections, railroad cars which you can load/unload, attach and remove. Also trains and station could be also removed. Generators for stations and trains and FileWriter for showing information about trains are also implemented. In addition, you can look trhough Presentation.java in wich I have described all important methods for this project.
The project was created for GUI subject PJAIT.
